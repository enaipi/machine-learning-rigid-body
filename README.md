# machine-learning-rigid-body
A simple collection of python(3) scripts that:
(i) simulate evolution of rigid body rotation
(ii) Learn the energy of the rigid body from the simulated points

Rigid body is simulated using the Poisson integrator developed in [1]. 

Using linear regression, the energy is then learned from the trajectory obtained in the simulation, more is explained in [2]. 
A simple usage is shown in learn_rigid_body.py script.
Learning using a distribution of initial conditions is done in script statistical_comparison.py, where also figures are plotted.
